Use the `jj-development-workflow` skill for the complete end-to-end process:

**When to use:** Starting development work, refining rough ideas into clear designs, need complete workflow from brainstorming through PR creation

**What it does:**
1. Refines rough ideas into clear designs
2. Creates planning commits (empty commits as your development roadmap)
3. Implements using the commit stack as your task list
4. Integrates code review after each task
5. Creates stacked PRs from commits

**Alternative: Creating new skills**
- Use `writing-skills` when creating new spellbook skills
- Use `testing-skills-with-subagents` to validate skills before deployment
