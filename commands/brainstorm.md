# Brainstorming

Use skills from the **development-workflows** group to refine rough ideas into clear, actionable plans:

**Primary skill:** `jj-development-workflow` - Complete workflow from idea refinement through planning, implementation, code review, and PR creation

**Supporting skills from jujutsu-version-control:**
- `jj-planning-commits` - Plan work with empty commits that describe each piece of work

**When creating new skills, use meta group:**
- `writing-skills` - Create new skills following best practices
- `testing-skills-with-subagents` - Validate skill quality before deployment
