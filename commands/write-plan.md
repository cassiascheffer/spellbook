# Planning Development Work

Use skills from the **jujutsu-version-control** group to create structured plans using commits:

**Primary skill:** `jj-planning-commits` - Plan tasks by creating empty commits with Jujutsu that describe each piece of work

**Supporting skills from jujutsu-version-control:**
- `jj-commit-workflow` - Manage commit stacks and reorganize work as you refine the plan

**For complete end-to-end workflow:**
- `jj-development-workflow` (development-workflows) - Complete workflow from idea refinement through planning, implementation, code review, and PR creation
