# Executing Development Plans

Use skills from multiple groups to implement features with quality and collaboration:

**Testing (always start here):**
- `test-driven-development` - Write tests first, watch them fail, then implement (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
- `condition-based-waiting` - Fix flaky tests with proper async patterns
- `testing-anti-patterns` - Avoid common testing mistakes

**Debugging (when issues arise):**
- `systematic-debugging` - Four-phase framework for finding root causes before fixing
- `root-cause-tracing` - Trace bugs backward through execution to find the source
- `verification-before-completion` - Verify fixes work before claiming completion
- `defense-in-depth` - Add validation at multiple layers to prevent bugs

**Collaboration:**
- `requesting-code-review` - Get code reviewed before merging
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` - Handle multiple independent failures concurrently
- `receiving-code-review` - Respond to feedback with technical rigor

**Jujutsu workflow:**
- `jj-commit-workflow` - Manage commit stacks during implementation
- `jj-stacked-prs` - Create reviewable PR stacks from commits
- `jj-pre-commit-hooks` - Handle hook failures properly
